# Gmail-to-drive-N8N-
This project builds an AI automation agent using n8n to manage emails efficiently. It automatically fetches new emails, creates folders in cloud storage using the sender’s name, and saves both attachments and email content. The goal is to help companies reduce manual email handling and improve productivity without opening emails.
